repository for hackdavis 2022 project ReqCheq✅

# Inspiration
ReqCheq started with an idea from student, Sunny Zhou during his struggle of trying to declare a major. Created by students who also struggled through the chaotic nature of finding which classes to take and what major to choose, ReqCheq’s mission is to help students in their journey of self discovery while at college by making the class scheduling side of college easier.

# What we intended
Our program takes a student’s major and courses they have taken, and presents them with a list of courses that they have satisfied the prerequisites to.

# How we built it
We used python for the backend, utilizing the modules such as, beautifulsoup4, requests, sys, os, PyPDF2, and re. For the front end, we drafted the design using Figma and began to code it into html and css.

# Challenges we ran into
Since this was our first time doing most of the tasks at hand, we had to learn html, css, figma, and the many python modules from scratch. This meant reading and rereading the documentation, and following long tutorials. The UC Davis General Catalog required hours of painstaking scanning of the html structure, looking for the data that we required.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Coming into the hackathon, we all had little experience building a project from scratch. We were able to build a web and PDF scraper that scraped the entire UC Davis course catalog, and found that UC Davis offers more than 13,000 courses to both undergrads and grad students. While we had little knowledge with front end development, we were able to learn HTML, CSS, and Figma, and built a functional Figma prototype of our website.

# What we learned
Learning how to use HTML and Figma from scratch, to the extent where we now have a working prototype

# What's Next for ReqCheq
ReqCheq’s next steps includes writing code to connect our front end Figma design with the backend program that we wrote to create a functional website. We hope to also add more functionalities, like a course rating function and uploading course syllabi, to our project in the future.
